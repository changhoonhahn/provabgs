The PROVABGS catalog will provide measurements of galaxy properties, such as stellar mass, 
star formation rate, stellar metallicity, and stellar age for >10 million galaxies of the 
[DESI](http://desi.lbl.gov/) Bright Galaxy Survey. 
Full posterior distributions of these galaxy properties will be inferred using state-of-the-art
Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of DESI spectroscopy and photometry.

The `provabgs` Python package provides 

- a state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis (SPS) model based on
  non-parametric prescription for star formation history, a metallicity 
  history that varies over the age of the galaxy, and a flexible dust 
  prescription. 
- a neural network emulator (Kwon *et al.* in prep) for the SPS model
  that is >100x faster than the original SPS model and enables accelerated 
  inference. Full posteriors of the 12 SPS parameters can be derived in 
  ~10 minutes. The emulator is currently designed for galaxies from 0 < z < 0.6.
- a Bayesian inference pipeline based on the [zeus](https://github.com/minaskar/zeus)
  ensemble slice Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sample.

and [Hahn *et al* (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01809)

## Installation
To install the package, clone the github repo and use `pip` to install  
```bash
# clone github repo 
git clone https://github.com/changhoonhahn/provabgs.git

cd provabgs

# install 
pip install -e . 
```

### requirements
If you only plan to use `provabgs` with the neural emulators, then `provabgs` 
does not require `fsps`. However, if you want to use the original SPS model, 
you will need to install `python-fsps`.  See `python-fsps`
[documentation](https://python-fsps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for installation
instruction. 

If you're using `provabgs` on NERSC, see [below](#fsps-on-nersc) for 
some notes on installing `FSPS` on `NERSC`.

### fsps on NERSC
I've been running into some issues installing and using `fsps` on NERSC. *e.g.*
there's an import error with libgfotran.so.5. The following may resolve the problem... 
```
module unload PrgEnv-intel
module load PrgEnv-gnu

```

## Example
Checkout the [nb/example.ipybn](https://github.com/changhoonhahn/provabgs/blob/main/nb/example.ipynb) 
notebook for an example on conducting Bayesian SED modeling on galaxy 
spectra using `provabgs`. It requires less than 10 lines of code and 
about 10 minutes!

If you're interested in conducting Bayesian SED modeling on DESI spectra in
particular, check out the [nb/tutorial_desispec.ipynb](https://github.com/changhoonhahn/provabgs/blob/main/nb/tutorial_desispec.ipynb)
notebook.

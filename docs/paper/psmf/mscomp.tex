\section{Stellar Mass Completeness} \label{sec:mscomp}

First, we take galaxies with $i \Delta z < z < (i+1) \Delta z$. 

For each galaxy take their best-fit SED from {\sc PROVABGS} and artificially redshift it to 
$z' = z + \Delta z$.

afterward, calculate the $r$ band magnitude using the best-fit SED and
determine whether the galaxy at $z'$ would be within the target selection. 


We then compare the $M_*$ distributions and determine the $M_*$ below which  a
significant number of galaxies are excluded from the sample.
